# Deepfake Voice Detection using LSTM

With the rapid advancement of generative AI, deepfake voices have emerged as a growing concern in security, media integrity, and digital trust. This project makes use of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to detect synthetic voices by analyzing speech patterns and audio features such as MFCCs. The goal was to build a reliable system that can distinguish between real and AI-generated (fake) audio samples.

### ðŸš€ Features

* Preprocessing of audio signals for training and evaluation.
* Extraction of MFCC features for speech analysis.
* LSTM-based neural network tailored for sequential audio data.
* Model evaluation with accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrix.

### ðŸ“Š Dataset
The [Deep Voice: Deepfake Voice Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/deep-voice-deepfake-voice-recognition) from Kaggle has been used to train and test the model. This dataset contains real and deepfake audio samples, enabling robust training for detection.
